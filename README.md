# PlantCentral
In super early developement and is just a hobby project for me.
An IoT application that uses a central webserver to store data and administrate "plants". 
Data about the plants are collected from nodes made from nodeMCU boards with a soil moisture sensor.

Goals:
- plant status update realtime in app using reactjs.
- Use AI to calculate when plant need to be watered next/how often based on history data.
- API to get data about users plants from server.
- Loginn and multiple users.
- Have multiple "types" of plants with stats and recomendations on how to, what to and when to take care of plant.
